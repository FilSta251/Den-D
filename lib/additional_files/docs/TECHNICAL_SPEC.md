- **Services**: Implement business logic and functionality, including:
  - **AuthService** for authentication.
  - **NotificationService** for handling notifications.
  - **PaymentService** for managing in-app purchases.
  - **LocalStorageService** for offline data storage.
  - **AnalyticsService** for logging events and screen views.
  - **CrashReportingService** for error reporting.
- **Screens**: Represent UI screens (e.g., Authentication, Home, Profile, Settings).
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI components (custom app bar, drawer, error dialogs).
- **Utils**: Global constants, validators, and configuration management.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Managed via GetIt, allowing for loose coupling and easier testing.
- **CI/CD**: Automated build, test, and deployment pipelines are configured using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and CircleCI.

### 3.2 Technology Stack

- **Flutter**: For building the mobile application.
- **Firebase**: Provides backend services:
  - **Firebase Auth** for authentication.
  - **Firestore** for real-time data storage.
  - **Firebase Analytics** for usage analytics.
  - **Firebase Crashlytics** for crash reporting.
- **GetIt**: For dependency injection.
- **SharedPreferences**: For local data storage.
- **In-app Purchase**: For managing transactions.
- **Fastlane**: For deployment automation.
- **CI/CD Tools**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI.
